# About the author

I have been a software developer since 1970, working with systems as small as Android and Apple ][ and as large as IBM mainframes.

3D printing is a new interest for me and I found a shortage of simple how-to material for my Adimlab Gantry Pro. This is my collection of how-to articles for others to share.

I have no affiliation or financial realtionship with any of the vendors mentioned in these articles.
