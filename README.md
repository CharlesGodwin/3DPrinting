# About the author

Except when noted specifically in the article, all material is the work of Charles Godwin.

I have been a software developer since 1970, working with systems as small as Android and Apple ][ and as large as IBM mainframes.

3D printing is a new interest for me and I found a shortage of simple how-to material for my ADIMlab Gantry Pro. This is my collection of my experiences others to share.

I have no affiliation or financial relationship with any of the vendors or products mentioned in these articles.
