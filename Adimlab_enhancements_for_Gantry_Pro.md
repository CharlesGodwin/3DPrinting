# Adimlab Enhancements for Gantry Pro


## OctoPrint

This is a computer-based web server for managing your printer. [Full information is here.](https://octoprint.org/) It allows management of most printer function using a browser interface from anywhere in your network. Many users implement the server on a Raspberry Pi and the organization markets all-in-one turnkey Pi systems for those who chose not to build their own system. I have installed a Pi based unit and it has significantly improved my access to the printer. The only time I use the printer's LCD screen and controls is when I am levelling the bed. I use OctoPrint interface with my slicer to directly download the gcode to the server. I can control start and stop and check job status using my browser. It also supports a camera interface so you can watch your printer from afar. I have no recommendation on which camera to use or how to mount it.

## Automatic Bed Levelling

Automatic bed leveling eliminates problems with adjusting for warped beds. The software examines multiple points on the bed and calculates the correct distance, in software, to set the height of the nozzle. This takes bed levelling out of your hands, so bed preparation gets much simpler/

At the time of writing this there was no packaged automatic bed leveller available although [Ray Shain](https://everybody3dprints.com/) is developing one and it is expected soon. I look forward to its availability as I will install bed leveling as soon as its available.

## Cabinet or Enclosure

Many use a cabinet to enclose the entire printer to allow for a warm chamber for printing and noise reduction. I have found many designs but not that match my budget. The Gantry Pro is a big printer, so some quick solutions will not work.
