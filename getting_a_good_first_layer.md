# Getting a Good First Layer

I have found that every time I print something, I should properly prepare my bed to ensure a good start to each print. Proper preparation is done in two steps. Any time I omit one of these steps I quickly regret it as my first layer does not go well and I must start over.

There are many, many opinions in the 3D printing world about what is the best method of bed adhesion. [Google `3d print bed adhesion`](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+print+bed+adhesion) and you will get over 1.3 million answers. ;)

I am going to cover only the two I have experienced.
1. Using just a clean bare bed
2. Using a glue stick to prepare the bed

__Be sure to  prepare the bed surface every time you print__

## __Bed preparation__
   
### __Bare Bed Surface__
Thank you to Mark for his [article](https://www.envirolaser3d.com/blogs/ottawa-filaments-envirolasers-3d-shop/build-plate-adhesion-problems-the-ultimate-solution) about the merits of bare surface printing. Be sure to prepare your printer with a super clean bed glass, then keep it clean.

Every time you print, clean the surface with a bit of Windex or isopropyl alcohol. You only need to touch up any area you have touched. If you are careful and use a cloth when removing you model you can avoid touching the glass and contaminating it.

The advantage of this process is it is relatively low effort. The only downside I've found is it seems to be effective and I need to wait for the bed to cool before I can remove a model.

### __Glue Stick Surface__
#### __Clean the bed and apply fresh glue__
Every time I prepare the bed, I use a water bottle to first wet the surface of the bed.
__Be careful to not spray any electronics or wiring.__

I then wipe off all the previous glue. I have two cloths. One I always use for the initial wipe off and it quickly accumulates lots of glue, but I do not care. After I wipe off most of the glue, I wet the glass again and wipe the bed clean and dry with the second, less dirty, cloth. Rinse and dry these cloths regularly. Then I apply fresh glue. I use an Elmer's Purple dissolvable paper glue stick to apply a complete layer of glue to the glass. I cover the entire surface running the stick up and down and then repeat with the stick running across. I clean and glue the bed when it is still cool and before heating.

The advantages of this method is renews each time and, although models stick to the bed, items are easy to remove. The disadvantage is the amount of effort required.
## **Bed levelling**
I always, always, bed level each time. Any time I get rushed and omit this step, I regret it. The Owners Manual, in section 6 (2), describes the bed levelling procedure. I quickly found I could not get good, repeatable, results using paper as a thickness guide, so I now use a mechanics feeler gauge. These are readily available in auto supply stores, hardware stores and online. The gauges are made of steel so are easy to handle and provide repeatable results. I use a gauge with 0.10mm thickness. Adjust so the extruder just drags as the gauge is moved under it gives me good results. Your performance may vary. I have situations where using just 0.05mm works and sometimes 0.10mm is best.

## **Clogged nozzle**
Sooner or later, when least expected, you will get a clogged nozzle. The first signs are either a bad first layer with little or no filament or no filament coming out of the nozzle during a print. Keep spare nozzles on hand, they are cheap but important. Preheat the end (nozzle) to allow removing the nozzle. The old nozzle must be removed when it is hot, so preheat the end. The nozzle is removed with a 7mm nut driver or 7mm wrench. The nut driver is easier to use when installing the new nozzle. The end of the heater assembly must be held in place while loosening and tightening the nozzle. This requires a 17mm wrench.
## **First layer**
If your first layer does not go down without any 'oops' filament, or any filament sticking to itself, or filament lifting from the bed then you have a good chance of a good print. If not, stop and recheck your preparation and levelling. _Nothing can correct a bad first layer_.
